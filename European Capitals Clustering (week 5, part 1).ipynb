    "The culture of Europe is rooted in the art, architecture, film, different types of music, literature, and philosophy that originated from the continent of Europe. \n",
    "\n",
    "European culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its \"common cultural heritage\". Because of the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing conception of European culture. Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe. \n",
